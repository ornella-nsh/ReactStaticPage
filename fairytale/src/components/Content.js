      In a village lived a sweet little girl who used to wear a little red hood, and everybody used to call her
      Little Red Riding Hood. One day her mother asked her to go and visit her grandmother, who was ill.
      The grandmother used to live near the woods. Little Red Riding Hood set out for her grandmother’s place, passing the woods.
      She met a wolf there and naively pointed out her grandmother’s house to him. The sly wolf reached the grandmother’s house
      before Little Red Riding Hood and ate the poor old woman. Next came the little girl, and the wolf ate her too.

      The wolf slept on the old woman’s bed after eating and started snoring loudly.
      A huntsman passing by heard the loud snoring and thought that something was fishy and peeked inside the house.
      The huntsman cut open the wolf, and Little Red Riding Hood and the old woman jumped out of the wolf’s body.
      They thanked the huntsman for saving their life. Little Red Riding Hood decided not to trust strangers after this.
